[space-location-description]
tchekor=A scorched, storm-ravaged planet where molten rivers carve through ashen plains and towering plateaus crackle with relentless lightning storms. Sulfuric acid geysers erupt alongside ancient ruins, shrouded in swirling toxic winds. Oceans of oil simmer beneath the fiery sky, their surfaces rippling with electric arcs. Elevated rails are the only means to traverse its molten seas and treacherous landscapes, making survival a feat of ingenuity and endurance.
